            <p> Hello! Welcome to my portfolio!

I am born in South Korea but was raised in Vancouver, Canada.

I began working on my portfolio summer 2019 when I took
time to explore my interests. After talking to experienced designers and having taken Intro to Product Design class in my freshman year, I realized that Product Design was exactly why I came to Cornell University - to work with people and technology.

            </p>
        <br />
            <p>I applied to my major, having no clue on what to become but
            knowing that I wanted to work in an area where technology and people were interconnected.

            I’ve always believed technology excited solely for the people
            and people, as I have, are also benefited by technology interchangeably.


            I know I have a lot to learn from others and from my surroundings,
             and I have been loving it so far. I hope to one day be able to make a greater social impact using my <strong>technical skills, creativity,</strong> and <strong>empathy</strong>!</p>
